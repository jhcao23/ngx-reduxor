## This is a folk repository from [ngx-reduxor](https://github.com/kmathy/ngx-reduxor)
I am trying to make it customizable for myself and more developers. But not sure if I have enough time to do this.

## How to run your own ngx-reduxor locally
- Obviously you will know download your folk repo by `git clone`
- `rm -rf .npmignore .release-it.json yarn.lock` as I only use `yarn` not `npm`
- `yarn install` then `yarn link` so that you can invoke your own `ngx-reduxor` anywhere in your laptop then its done.

## MANUAL CHANGES NEEDED:
- update URLs in `url.constants.ts` accordingly

## Intro
If you are a user of @ngrx libs, check this generator! This will help you to save time by creating an architecture for your ngrx files. 

* Create an **entity** is easy. Just provide a name and it will generate all the files!
* Create a **router-serializer** to use @ngrx/router-store.
* Provide a module to easily import all the reducers, effects and services in your Angular app.
* MetaReducer: non-invasive logger in development.
* Mainly inspired by the [ngrx styleguide](https://github.com/orizens/ngrx-styleguide)
* Use the latest Angular HttpClient.
* Use lettable operators in Rxjs.
* Provide unit tests.

## prerequisites

```
@ngrx/store@^5.0.0 // Required
@ngrx/effects@^5.0.1 // Required
@ngrx/entity@^5.0.1 // Optional but recommended. (Required if you generate entity)
ngrx-store-freeze // Optional but recommended. Useful to prevent state mutation.
```

## Getting Started
### Globally
Install it via npm:

```shell
npm install -g ngx-reduxor
```

or with Yarn:
```shell
yarn global add ngx-reduxor
```
### Locally in a project
Install it via npm:

```shell
npm install ngx-reduxor --save-dev
```

or with Yarn:
```shell
yarn add --dev ngx-reduxor
```

## Configuration

If you want to install it locally, you have to add the following in your package.json:

```
  ...
  "scripts": {
    "ngx-reduxor": "ngx-reduxor"
  },
```

If installed globally, you can directly use the Generator like the Angular CLI.<br>
The first time you launch the generator, it will create a new file for the configuration:

| Option             | Description                                                             | Type    | Default           |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------|
| BASE_PATH          | Path to put the generated files                                         | String  | './src/app/store' |
| SEPARATE_DIRECTORY | If true, separate each action, reducer, service,... In their own folder | Boolean | false             |
| IGNORE_SPEC        | If true, skip generation of spec files                                  | Boolean | false             |

## Usage
You need to use the generator at the root of your project.

If installed globally:
```shell
ngx-reduxor
```

Otherwise:
```
npm run ngx-reduxor
```

## Import to your Angular application
A module is created once you generate your first ngrx files. This module contains all the necessary: Reducers, interfaces, meta-reducers, effects,...
You just need to import the module inside the AppModule and it will expose the store in your application.

```
...
import { StoreReduxorModule } from './path/to/your/store-reduxor.module';
...
@NgModule({
...
imports: [
  ...
  StoreReduxorModule.forRoot(),
  ...
]
...
```

## Generate Entity

If you want to generate an entity, you need to provide the **singular** of the name. After, you will be asked to provide
the plural of this name in order to correctly generate the files.

## Generate router-serializer

To use this feature:
* You firstly need to generate your first store object. So that, the module and the required files (app.store,...)  are created.
* Ensure you have **@ngrx/router-store** installed in your project and existing in your package.json.

If these two conditions are met, you will be able to generate the router-serializer (it also update store-reduxor.module and app.store with routerReducer ect)
